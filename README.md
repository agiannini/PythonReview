Hi,

This application allows the user to search database of books.

The database is hosted on  Heroku. It contains three tables.

The app generates pages for each item in the database where the user can leave reviews. It also displays data from the goodreads api.

In addition, it has a feature that dispalys JSON data containing the reveiw
statistics for each book.

The application allows the user to login. If the user makes a post without being
logged in, it will default to anonymous.
